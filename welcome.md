Welcome to PRAG

Hello!

    gathering data on TI cases, their stories, facts and interpretations of said facts by TIs, as well as any related data
    research and analysis of collected data to advance our understanding of the phenomenon
    preparation and publication of research result, communicating them to TI community as well as to general population
